# Machine-Learning-Study

## Repo descriptionddd
This repository contains a number of notebooks that I used in my studies of certain python lybraries and tools to further my skills in the domain of machine learning.
It also contains some of the challenges and tests I used to hone my skills or tests I got in my interviews.

I'll start first by going over the most commun problems in machine learning ( **classification / regression / clustering**), and slowly but surely get into the knitty gritty of things.

This repository will also contain some tips and cheats to apply machine learning faster and cleaner.


As this goes on I want to get more and more competent in this subject and get a deep intuition into its inner workings

It also contains some study materials I used to brush up on my knowledge.
