# Machine-Learning-Study-
This repository contains a number of notebooks that I used in my studies of certain python lybraries and tools to further my skills in the domain of machine learning.
It also contains some of the challenges and tests I used to hone my skills.

I'll start first by going over the most commun problems in machine learning ( classification / regression / clustering ), and slowly but surely get into the knitty gritty of things .
